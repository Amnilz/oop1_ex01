after showing the shape the program will also gives info about the shape

- Length
- Area
- Height
- Perimeter
- center

and also shows the shape with scale by 2 if possible and the smallest bounding Rectangle of the shape

===== Files Created =====

Rectangle.h - used for the declartion of Rectangle class
Rectangle.cpp - used for the definitions of the functions for the Rectangle class

Triangle.h - used for the declartion of Triangle class
Triangle.cpp - used for the definitions of the functions for the Triangle class

IsocelesTriangle.h - used for the declartion of Triangle class
IsocelesTriangle.cpp - used for the definitions of the functions for the Triangle class

Window.h - used for the declartion of Window class
Window.cpp - used for the definitions of the functions for the Window class

===== Data Structers =====
the program build around classes used for the shapes
Rectangle
Triangle 
IsocelesTriangle
Window
and all of those classes uses the Vertex class to store x and y coordinates
for those shapes
